MUSICFLOW - Full-Stack Music Streaming Web Application

Project Description:
Developed a Spotify-inspired music streaming platform using modern web technologies, featuring real-time audio playback, user authentication, and playlist management. Implemented a hybrid data architecture supporting both guest users (local storage) and registered users (PostgreSQL database).

Technical Stack:
• Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
• Backend: Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API architecture
• Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, hybrid local/database storage
• State Management: React Query, Context API, custom hooks
• Audio: Custom audio player with global state management
• Authentication: JWT-less session management with bcrypt password hashing
• External APIs: Jamendo Music API integration for music streaming

Key Features Implemented:
• Real-time music streaming with custom audio player controls (play/pause, skip, volume, shuffle, repeat)
• User authentication system with secure password hashing and session persistence
• Dynamic playlist creation and management with real-time updates
• Favorites system for tracks with persistent storage
• Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
• Search functionality with genre-based music discovery
• Trending tracks and music recommendations
• Guest user experience with local storage playlists
• Database-driven user accounts with persistent data

Technical Achievements:
• Designed hybrid data architecture supporting both guest and authenticated users
• Implemented custom audio player hook with global state management
• Built responsive UI components using modern design patterns
• Created secure authentication system without external dependencies
• Optimized performance with React Query caching and efficient re-renders
• Developed comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems

Development Highlights:
• Full-stack application with complete user experience flow
• Modern React patterns including custom hooks and context providers
• Responsive design with mobile-first approach
• Real-time data synchronization across components
• Professional-grade code structure with TypeScript type safety
• Comprehensive state management for complex audio player functionality
